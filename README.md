## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

As a 7th-semester **Software Engineering** student at **UNICESUMAR**, I am driven by the challenge of continuous learning and adapting to new technologies. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can solve complex problems and grow professionally. My goal is to contribute to projects that not only challenge me technically but also create a significant and positive impact.

I am particularly interested in mobile development with **Kotlin** & **Jetpack Compose**, backend systems with **Java** & **Spring Boot**, and exploring the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and software engineering.
